## Do Now Application (To Do List App)

This project is my first Android project.
I did it as a school homework.
In this project:
5 missions per day
3 missions per week
3 missions per month
We can complete, delete and update these tasks by specifying
Since it is my first project, it is more amateur than my other projects.
But it is a usable application. You can make improvements on it and share it with me.
I develop other projects with Kotlin and Java and continue to improve myself. With this project, I will see the paths I have traveled years later. Thank you for reading.
